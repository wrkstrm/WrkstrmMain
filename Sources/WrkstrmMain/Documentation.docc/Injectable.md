# ``Injectable``

A protocol for injecting external resources into a type and verifying that dependencies are configured.

## Topics

### Managing Dependencies
- ``Resource``
- ``inject(_:)``
- ``assertDependencies()``

## Overview

`Injectable` decouples collaborators by allowing dependencies to be supplied from
the outside. Conforming types declare an associated ``Resource`` to represent the
dependency. Use ``inject(_:)`` to store the resource and ``assertDependencies()``
to ensure everything is wired correctly.

## Example

```swift
struct NetworkService {
    func request(_ path: String) { /* ... */ }
}

final class UserViewModel: Injectable {
    typealias Resource = NetworkService
    private var service: NetworkService?

    func inject(_ resource: NetworkService) {
        service = resource
    }

    func assertDependencies() {
        precondition(service != nil, "NetworkService must be injected")
    }
}
```
